→ Check GitHub Actions logs, test locally with `docker build`

### "Deployment not triggered"
→ Verify webhook URLs in GitHub secrets

### "Old code running"
→ Force pull new images: `docker pull yourname/ehr-api:dev --no-cache`

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **If you haven't started**: Read [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md)
2. **If you want full automation**: Read [DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md](./DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md)
3. **If you're ready to deploy**: Follow [GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md](./GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md)

---

## 📈 Deployment Stats

After setup, you'll have:
- **Build Time**: ~5-7 minutes
- **Deployment Time**: ~2-3 minutes
- **Total Time**: ~8-10 minutes from push to live
- **Manual Steps**: 0️⃣

Compare to manual deployment: 30+ minutes with multiple error-prone steps!

---

## ✨ What Makes This Special

### Traditional Deployment
1. SSH into server
2. Pull code
3. Build images (slow!)
4. Stop services
5. Start new services
6. Check logs
7. Hope it works
**Time**: 30+ minutes, error-prone

### Your New Workflow
1. Push code
2. ☕ Get coffee
3. It's deployed!
**Time**: ~10 minutes, automated

---

## 🎯 Remember

**The golden rule**: Push to the branch, let automation do the rest!

```bash
# This is all you need to remember
git push origin develop   # Dev
git push origin staging   # Staging
git push origin main      # Production
```

**Everything else is automatic!**
