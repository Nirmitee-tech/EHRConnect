# Default Roles Seeder Guide

## ✅ What's Done

I've created a comprehensive seeder that populates **13 default system roles** with proper permissions!

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run the Seeder

```bash
cd ehr-api
npm run seed:roles
```

**That's it!** The seeder will automatically:
- Create new system roles that don't exist
- Update existing system roles with latest permissions
- Show detailed progress for each role
- Display a summary table of all roles

## 📋 What Gets Seeded

### 13 Default System Roles:

| Role | Scope | Permissions | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Platform Administrator** | PLATFORM | 1 | Super admin with full platform access |
| **Organization Owner** | ORG | 30 | Complete organization control |
| **Organization Administrator** | ORG | 15 | Manage org settings and staff |
| **Doctor** | LOCATION | 27 | Full clinical access for physicians |
| **Clinician** | LOCATION | 26 | General clinical workflow access |
| **Nurse** | LOCATION | 23 | Patient care and vitals |
| **Front Desk** | LOCATION | 15 | Registration and appointments |
| **Lab Technician** | LOCATION | 8 | Lab order processing |
| **Radiologist** | LOCATION | 11 | Imaging results and reporting |
| **Pharmacist** | LOCATION | 10 | Medication dispensing |
| **Billing Clerk** | LOCATION | 15 | Billing and payments |
| **Auditor** | ORG | 24 | Read-only compliance access |
| **Viewer** | LOCATION | 6 | Basic read-only access |

## 🔄 How It Works

### On First Run:
- Creates all 13 system roles
- Inserts with proper permissions
- Shows ✓ Created for each role

### On Subsequent Runs:
- Updates existing roles with latest permissions
- Adds any new roles
- Shows ✓ Updated for existing, ✓ Created for new

### Output Example:
```
==============================================
Seeding Default System Roles
==============================================

Processing: Doctor (DOCTOR)
  Scope: LOCATION
  Permissions: 27
  ✓ Created new role

Processing: Nurse (NURSE)
  Scope: LOCATION
  Permissions: 23
  ✓ Updated existing role

...

==============================================
Seeding Complete!
==============================================
✓ Inserted: 2
✓ Updated: 11
✗ Skipped: 0
Total: 13

Current System Roles:
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Doctor                         | LOCATION     | 27 permissions
Nurse                          | LOCATION     | 23 permissions
...
```

## 📦 What's Included

### Scripts Available:

```bash
# Seed default roles
npm run seed:roles

# Sync permissions to Keycloak
npm run sync:permissions
```

### Files Created:

1. **`ehr-api/src/scripts/seed-default-roles.js`**
   - Complete seeder script
   - 13 role definitions with descriptions
   - Progress tracking
   - Summary output

2. **`ehr-api/package.json`** (updated)
   - Added `seed:roles` script
   - Added `sync:permissions` script

## 🎨 Using Seeded Roles in UI

After seeding, these roles are immediately available in your admin UI:

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/settings/roles`
2. See all 13 system roles in the "System Roles" section
3. Click any role to view its permissions
4. Click "Copy & Customize" to create org-specific versions

## 🔧 Customizing Default Roles

### Option 1: Modify the Seeder

Edit `ehr-api/src/scripts/seed-default-roles.js`:

```javascript
{
  key: 'DOCTOR',
  name: 'Doctor',
  description: 'Your custom description',
  scope_level: 'LOCATION',
  permissions: [
    'patients:*',
    'your:custom:permission',
    // Add more permissions
  ],
  is_system: true,
},
```

Then run:
```bash
npm run seed:roles
```

### Option 2: Use the UI

1. Go to `/settings/roles`
2. Find the role (e.g., "Doctor")
3. Click "Copy & Customize"
4. Modify permissions in the matrix
5. Save

This creates an org-specific copy without modifying the system role.

## 🗄️ Database Structure

Roles are stored in the `roles` table:

```sql
SELECT key, name, scope_level,
       jsonb_array_length(permissions) as perm_count,
       is_system
FROM roles
WHERE is_system = true;
```

**System Roles** have:
- `is_system = true`
- `org_id IS NULL`
- Cannot be deleted
- Can be copied per org

## 🚀 Integration Flow

```
1. Run seeder → Creates 13 system roles in database
2. Start backend → Roles available via API
3. Open UI → See roles in /settings/roles
4. Assign to users → Via user management
5. Sync to Keycloak → npm run sync:permissions
6. Login → Users get role permissions in JWT token
```

## ⚡ Quick Commands

```bash
# Initial setup
npm run seed:roles

# After role changes
npm run seed:roles  # Updates existing + adds new

# Sync to Keycloak
npm run sync:permissions

# View roles in database
PGPASSWORD=medplum123 psql -h localhost -U medplum -d medplum \
  -c "SELECT key, name, jsonb_array_length(permissions) as perms FROM roles WHERE is_system = true;"
```

## 📊 Verification

After seeding, verify with:

```bash
# API Check
curl http://localhost:8000/api/rbac/v2/roles | jq '.roles | length'
# Should output: 13

# Database Check
PGPASSWORD=medplum123 psql -h localhost -U medplum -d medplum \
  -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM roles WHERE is_system = true;"
# Should output: 13

# UI Check
# Navigate to http://localhost:3000/settings/roles
# Count roles in "System Roles" section
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Run seeder after migration**
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   npm run seed:roles
   ```

2. **Re-run after permission updates**
   - Modify seeder file
   - Run `npm run seed:roles`
   - Existing roles get updated

3. **Don't modify system roles in UI**
   - Use "Copy & Customize" instead
   - Keeps original intact for other orgs

4. **Sync to Keycloak after changes**
   ```bash
   npm run seed:roles
   npm run sync:permissions
   ```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "null value in column org_id"

**Solution:** Already fixed! The database trigger now skips system roles.

### Issue: Seeder shows "Skipped"

**Check:**
1. Database connection
2. Permissions on roles table
3. Error message in output

### Issue: Roles not visible in UI

**Check:**
1. Backend running?
2. API responding? `curl http://localhost:8000/api/rbac/v2/roles`
3. Browser console for errors
