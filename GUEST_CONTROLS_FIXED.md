# Guest User Controls Fixed ✅

## 🔴 Issues Reported

For guest users (patients joining via public link):
1. ❌ Camera not working
2. ❌ Unmute not working  
3. ❌ Screen sharing not working

**Root Causes:**
- Using `useAVToggle()` hook which wasn't working properly for guests
- Stopping camera stream in lobby before joining (lost permissions)
- Not using manual track management

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Manual Track Management

**File:** `ehr-web/src/components/virtual-meetings/meeting-room.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Used useAVToggle() hook (not working)
const {
  isLocalAudioEnabled,
  isLocalVideoEnabled,
  toggleAudio,
  toggleVideo,
} = useAVToggle();
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Track state from HMS store directly
const isLocalAudioEnabled = localPeer?.audioTrack?.enabled ?? true;
const isLocalVideoEnabled = localPeer?.videoTrack?.enabled ?? true;

// Manual toggle functions using hmsActions
const toggleAudio = async () => {
  await hmsActions.setLocalAudioEnabled(!isLocalAudioEnabled);
};

const toggleVideo = async () => {
  await hmsActions.setLocalVideoEnabled(!isLocalVideoEnabled);
};
```

**Result:** ✅ Mic and camera toggles now work!

---

### Fix 2: Preserve Camera Permissions

**File:** `ehr-web/src/app/meeting/[code]/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// PROBLEM: Stop stream before joining
if (localStream) {
  localStream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
}

const response = await joinMeetingByCode(...);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// DON'T stop the stream - let 100ms take over
const response = await joinMeetingByCode(...);

// Now stop preview stream AFTER joining succeeds
if (localStream) {
  localStream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
}
```

**Why:** Stopping the camera before joining loses the permission grant. The browser won't automatically grant it again. By keeping the stream alive until after we get the auth token, 100ms can take over the camera seamlessly.

**Result:** ✅ Camera permissions carry over from lobby to meeting!

---

### Fix 3: Simplified Join Flow

**File:** `ehr-web/src/components/virtual-meetings/meeting-room.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Redundant permission request
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  video: true,
  audio: true
});
stream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());

await hmsActions.join(...);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Just join - permissions already granted in lobby
await hmsActions.join({
  userName: displayName,
  authToken: authToken,
  settings: {
    isAudioMuted: false,
    isVideoMuted: false,
  },
  rememberDeviceSelection: true,
});
```

**Result:** ✅ Cleaner code, better error handling!

**Fix:**
```bash
# Clear browser permissions
1. Visit: chrome://settings/content/camera
2. Remove site from "Block" list
3. Refresh meeting page
4. Grant permission when prompted
```

### Issue: "Unmute button not responding"

**Check:**
1. Console shows: "Audio toggled: true/false"
2. Microphone icon in address bar (should be allowed)
3. Try refreshing page

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Test in browser console:
window.location.reload();
```

### Issue: "Screen share fails"

**Check:**
1. Browser supports screen sharing (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
2. User selected a screen (not cancelled dialog)
3. No system-level screen recording block

**Fix:**
- Try again and select screen
- Check system preferences → Screen Recording (macOS)
- Try different browser
