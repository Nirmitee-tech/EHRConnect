# Real-Time Meeting Status for Appointments

## Date: 2025-10-30
## Status: ✅ Complete

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: When a telehealth call is ongoing, there was no way to see its status on the appointment screen. After the call ended, appointments had to be manually marked as completed and new meetings had to be manually generated.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Real-Time Call Status Tracking**
- Created `useMeetingStatus` hook that polls meeting status every 5 seconds
- Shows live status: scheduled, active, ended, cancelled
- Tracks participant count
- Records start/end times

### 2. **Live Call Indicator**
- Prominent red "LIVE CALL" banner when meeting is active
- Shows participant count in real-time
- "Join Call" button for easy access
- Pulsing animation for visibility
- Displays meeting start time

### 3. **Auto-Complete on Call End**
- When meeting ends (status changes to 'ended')
- Appointment automatically marked as completed
- Encounter automatically closed
- Notification shown to user
- Appointment list refreshed

### 4. **Visual Indicators**
- **LIVE badge** on appointment cards (red, pulsing)
- Shows which appointments have active calls
- Visible in calendar views (month, week, day)
- Clear video icon for telehealth

### 5. **Smart Meeting Management**
- If meeting exists: Shows "Join Video Call" button
- If no meeting: Shows "Start Video Call" button
- Displays meeting code for easy reference
- One-click join from appointment details

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

### Polling Strategy
```typescript
// Hook polls every 5 seconds
const { meetingStatus } = useMeetingStatus(meetingCode, 5000);

// Status structure
{
  isActive: boolean,
  status: 'scheduled' | 'active' | 'ended' | 'cancelled',
  participantCount: number,
  startedAt: string,
  endedAt: string
}
```

### Auto-Complete Logic
```typescript
// In LiveCallIndicator
useEffect(() => {
  if (meetingStatus?.status === 'ended' && onMeetingEnded) {
    onMeetingEnded(); // Trigger callback
  }
}, [meetingStatus?.status]);

// In AppointmentDetailsDrawer
const handleCallEnded = async () => {
  await handleCompleteAppointment(); // Auto-complete
  alert('Video call ended. Appointment completed.');
  onAppointmentUpdated?.(); // Refresh list
};
```

### Visual Indicator
```typescript
// Compact card shows badge
{isLive && (
  <span className="bg-red-500 text-white px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded animate-pulse">
    <Video className="w-2.5 h-2.5" />
    LIVE
  </span>
)}
```
