CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT
================================================================================

ALERT RULES IMPLEMENTED:
- Infection Detection: 2+ clinical indicators + culture confirmation
- Stalled Healing: <5% weekly area reduction for 2+ weeks
- Osteomyelitis: Probe-to-bone positive + culture + imaging
- Vascular Crisis: ABI <0.4 with advancing necrosis
- Specialist Referral: Automatic routing to vascular surgery, infectious disease, etc.

DRESSING SELECTION ALGORITHM:
- 5-level decision tree (infection → exudate → tissue → epithelialization)
- 200+ dressing options supported (passive, interactive, active, negative pressure)
- Modifiers for diabetic neuropathy (offloading devices), venous disease (compression)

HEALING PROGRESSION CALCULATION:
- Formula: (Previous_Area - Current_Area) / Previous_Area × 100
- Expected rates by type: Pressure 10-15%, Diabetic 5-10%, Venous 5-8%
- Automated alerts for abnormal trajectories

================================================================================
WORKFLOW SPECIFICATIONS
================================================================================

ASSESSMENT PHASES:
1. Day 0 (Initial): 15-20 minutes - Complete registration, full framework, photo
2. Days 1-7 (Acute): Daily to q48h - Monitor changes, infection, pain control
3. Weeks 2-4 (Proliferative): 2-3x per week - Calculate healing rate, monitor tissue
4. Weeks 4+ (Remodeling): Weekly to biweekly - Track closure, scar maturation

CRITICAL DECISION POINTS:
- Week 2 Healing Check: <5% → stalled wound alert, 5-10% → monitor, >10% → continue
- Any infection signs: Immediate culture + antibiotic evaluation
- Osteomyelitis detection: Urgent vascular surgery + infectious disease consult
- Vascular insufficiency: ABI <0.7 in diabetic foot → vascular surgery

SPECIALIST REFERRAL CRITERIA:
- Vascular Surgery: ABI <0.7, arterial insufficiency, gangrene, osteomyelitis
- Infectious Disease: Culture-positive, unusual organisms, biofilm, spreading cellulitis
- Endocrinology: Diabetic foot with A1C >8%, recurrent ulceration
- Podiatry: Diabetic foot, deformity, neuropathy, offloading device need
- Nutrition: Albumin <3.5, BMI <18.5, unintentional weight loss
