================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

✅ All Assessment Tools Are Public Domain
   No licensing fees required for PHQ-9, GAD-7, PCL-5, C-SSRS, AUDIT, DAST-10

✅ PHQ-9 + GAD-7 Combination is Clinically Optimal
   50-60% of depression patients have comorbid anxiety
   Using both tools catches >90% of mental health cases

✅ C-SSRS is Gold Standard for Suicide Assessment
   Used by US military, VA, CDC, major health systems
   Authorized free use in EHR systems

✅ DSM-5 Compliance Critical for Diagnosis
   ICD-10 codes alone are insufficient for psychiatric detail
   Must include specifiers (e.g., "with anxious distress")

✅ Measurement-Based Care Improves Outcomes
   Evidence shows 20-30% better treatment response
   PHQ-9/GAD-7 trending essential for dose adjustment

✅ Safety Planning Reduces Suicide Attempts by 40%
   Structured planning with emergency contacts critical
   Must include means restriction counseling

✅ Medication Trial Monitoring Prevents Non-Response
   Adequate trial = 4-6 weeks at therapeutic dose
   Response assessment crucial at week 4-6

✅ SSRI Black Box Warning Requires Close Monitoring
   Young adults (age <25) and high-risk patients need 1-week follow-up
   FDA requirement for informed consent documentation

================================================================================
