# Public Meeting Access - FIXED ✅

## 🔴 Issue

**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/meeting/96WZXDFG`

**Problem:** Middleware was redirecting unauthenticated users to login page, preventing public access to meeting links.

**Error Behavior:**
- Patient clicks meeting link
- Gets redirected to: `http://localhost:3000/?callbackUrl=/meeting/96WZXDFG`
- Cannot join meeting without logging in ❌

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

**File:** `ehr-web/src/middleware.ts`

**Change:** Added `/meeting` and `/join` paths to `PUBLIC_PATHS` array

```typescript
const PUBLIC_PATHS = [
  '/api/auth',
  '/api/fhir',
  '/auth',
  '/login',
  '/register',
  '/verify-email',
  '/forgot-password',
  '/reset-password',
  '/_next',
  '/favicon.ico',
  '/api/health',
  '/widget',
  '/api/public',
  '/meeting',  // ✅ Added - Public meeting links for patients
  '/join',     // ✅ Added - Alternative public meeting join path
];
```

**Result:** Unauthenticated users can now access meeting links directly! ✅
