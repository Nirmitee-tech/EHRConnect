# Blank Canvas Track - FIXED ✅

## 🔴 Problem Identified from Console Logs

```
[HMSLocalVideoTrack] replaceTrackWithBlank, Previous track stopped 
MediaStreamTrack newTrack CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack
```

**What this means:**
- Your actual camera track was stopped/lost
- 100ms replaced it with a **blank canvas track** (placeholder)
- That's why you see no video - it's showing a blank canvas, not your camera!

**Why it happened:**
- The lobby camera stream was stopped too early
- 100ms tried to join but couldn't get camera access again
- It created a placeholder blank canvas instead

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Delay Stopping Lobby Camera

**File:** `ehr-web/src/app/meeting/[code]/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// PROBLEM: Stop camera immediately
if (localStream) {
  localStream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
}

const response = await joinMeetingByCode(...);
setViewState('meeting');
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Get auth token first
const response = await joinMeetingByCode(...);
setViewState('meeting');

// WAIT 2 seconds before stopping preview
setTimeout(() => {
  if (localStream) {
    localStream.getTracks().forEach(track => track.stop());
  }
}, 2000); // Let 100ms connect first!
```

**Why:** Gives 100ms time to establish its own camera connection before we stop the preview.

---

### Fix 2: Use Track-Level Toggle

**File:** `ehr-web/src/components/virtual-meetings/meeting-room.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// PROBLEM: This caused track replacement
await hmsActions.setLocalVideoEnabled(!isLocalVideoEnabled);
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Use track-level control instead
const videoTrack = localPeer?.videoTrack;
if (videoTrack) {
  await hmsActions.setEnabledTrack(videoTrack, !isLocalVideoEnabled);
}
```

**Why:** `setEnabledTrack()` enables/disables the track without replacing it. The previous method was causing 100ms to replace the track with a blank canvas.

---

### Fix 3: Detect & Fix Blank Canvas

**File:** `ehr-web/src/components/virtual-meetings/meeting-room.tsx`

**New code:**
```typescript
// Auto-detect blank canvas and fix it
if (localPeer.videoTrack) {
  const trackLabel = nativeTrack?.label;
  
  // If it's a canvas track, try to get real camera
  if (trackLabel?.includes('canvas') || trackLabel?.includes('Canvas')) {
    console.warn('Detected blank canvas track! Fixing...');
    
    // Turn off and on to force camera request
    await hmsActions.setLocalVideoEnabled(false);
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
    await hmsActions.setLocalVideoEnabled(true);
  }
}
```

**Why:** If we detect a blank canvas track on join, automatically try to replace it with real camera.

---

### Fix 4: Better Toggle State

**Before:**
```typescript
const isLocalVideoEnabled = localPeer?.videoTrack?.enabled ?? true;
```

**After:**
```typescript
const isLocalVideoEnabled = localPeer?.videoEnabled ?? true;
```

**Why:** Use the peer's `videoEnabled` property instead of track's `enabled`. More reliable.

## 🧪 Test It Now

### Step 1: Refresh Everything
```bash
# Hard refresh frontend
Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

### Step 2: Create FRESH Meeting
1. Go to Appointments
2. Click "Start Video Call"
3. Use the NEW meeting link

### Step 3: Join with Console Open
```
Press F12 → Console tab → Watch for:
```

**Look for these NEW logs:**
```
[MeetingRoom] Connected! Local peer: {...}
[MeetingRoom] Video track type: video
[MeetingRoom] Video track label: Camera (should NOT say canvas!)
[MeetingRoom] Video track source: regular

If you see "canvas" in label:
[MeetingRoom] Detected blank canvas track! Attempting to get real camera...
[MeetingRoom] Attempted to replace blank track with camera
```

### Step 4: Test Toggles
```
1. Click camera button
   → Should log: "Video toggled: true/false"
   → Should NOT log: "No video track found"

2. Click mic button
   → Should log: "Audio toggled: true/false"
   → Should NOT log: "No audio track found"
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### On Join:
1. **Lobby:** See camera preview ✅
2. **Click "Join now"**
3. **Meeting loads**
4. **Wait 1-2 seconds** (100ms connecting)
5. **Camera appears!** ✅
6. **NOT a blank screen** ✅

### Console Logs:
```
✅ Good:
[MeetingRoom] Video track label: FaceTime HD Camera
[MeetingRoom] Video track type: video
[MeetingRoom] Video track source: regular

❌ Bad (if you still see):
[MeetingRoom] Video track label: canvas
[HMSLocalVideoTrack] replaceTrackWithBlank
```

## 🔍 Why This Happened

### The Timeline:

1. **Lobby:** User grants camera permission ✅
2. **Preview works:** Camera stream created ✅
3. **User clicks "Join now"**
4. **OLD CODE:** Stop camera stream immediately ❌
5. **100ms joins:** Tries to get camera access ❌
6. **Browser:** "Camera already stopped, no permission" ❌
7. **100ms:** "Can't get camera, use blank canvas instead" ❌
8. **Result:** User sees blank screen/avatar ❌

### The Fix:

1. **Lobby:** User grants camera permission ✅
2. **Preview works:** Camera stream created ✅
3. **User clicks "Join now"**
4. **NEW CODE:** DON'T stop stream yet ✅
5. **100ms joins:** Gets camera access (permission still active) ✅
6. **100ms connects:** Camera working ✅
7. **After 2 seconds:** Stop preview stream (no longer needed) ✅
8. **Result:** User sees camera video ✅

## 📊 Comparison

| Action | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Join meeting** | Stop camera → 100ms joins | 100ms joins → Wait → Stop camera |
| **Video toggle** | `setLocalVideoEnabled()` | `setEnabledTrack()` |
| **Track type** | Canvas (blank) | Camera (real) |
| **User sees** | Avatar/blank screen | Video feed |
| **Clicking video button** | Nothing happens | Toggles on/off |

## 🚀 If Still Not Working

### Check These Console Logs:

```javascript
// 1. Is video track a canvas?
[MeetingRoom] Video track label: ???

// 2. Are toggles working?
Video toggled: true/false  (should appear when clicking)

// 3. Does track exist?
[MeetingRoom] Local video track: should show an ID, not null
```

### Share These:
1. **All [MeetingRoom] logs**
2. **Video track label** (Camera or canvas?)
3. **Does lobby preview work?** (YES/NO)
4. **What browser?** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

---

## 💡 Key Takeaway

**The Problem:** Camera stream was stopped before 100ms could take it over, causing 100ms to use a blank canvas placeholder instead.

**The Solution:** Keep camera stream alive longer, giving 100ms time to establish its own connection with proper camera access.

**Result:** Real camera feed instead of blank canvas! 🎥✅

## ✅ Testing Checklist

After refreshing:

- [ ] Create fresh meeting from appointment
- [ ] Open console (F12)
- [ ] Join meeting
- [ ] Check console for "Canvas" in track label
- [ ] See if auto-fix triggers (if canvas detected)
- [ ] Try toggling camera on/off
- [ ] Try toggling mic on/off
- [ ] Verify camera shows (not avatar/blank)
- [ ] Check other participants can see you

## 🎉 Expected Result

**Camera should now work!** No more blank canvas track. Real video feed from your camera. ✅

Refresh the page and test with a NEW meeting! 🚀
