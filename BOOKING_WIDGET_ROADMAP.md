### Test with Real Users
Get 5 patients to test the widget and watch them use it. You'll discover issues you never thought of.

### Focus on Mobile First
60%+ of bookings will be on mobile. Design for mobile, then adapt to desktop.

### Measure Everything
Add analytics from day 1. Track:
- Where users drop off
- How long each step takes
- What appointment types are most popular
- Which providers get booked most

### Iterate Quickly
Ship small improvements daily rather than waiting for the "perfect" widget.
